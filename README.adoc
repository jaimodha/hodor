**HODOR** play two key roles

- Acts as a API gateway to route all the incomming request to the backend API's using **Netflix Zuul**.
- **Spring Security OAuth2 Resource Server** to authenctiate all the endoints with a OAuth2 complient identity server.

We are going to use **Keycloak** as our identity server. But the goal is to build the Hodor gateway in a way that we can easily replace keyclaok with any identity provider (Hopefully not something as insane as WSO2).
